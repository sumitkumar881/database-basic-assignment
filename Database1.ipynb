        "# 3.Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.\n",
        "Ans:-The NOT NULL constraint is applied to a column to ensure that it always contains a valid value and does not store NULL values. This is important because:\n",
        "Ensures Data Completeness Prevents missing or incomplete records, which could cause inconsistencies.\n",
        "Maintains Data Integrity Guarantees that critical fields always contain meaningful values.\n",
        "Avoids Unexpected Errors  Queries relying on certain columns (e.g., foreign keys or computations) will not fail due to NULL values.\n",
        "1. Mandatory Fields:\n",
        "You want to ensure that every row in the table has a value for the column, which is crucial\n",
        "for certain business operations. For example, in a customer table, the customer_name\n",
        "column should not allow NULL because every record must have a customer name.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data Integrity:\n",
        "Applying NOT NULL guarantees that the column cannot be left blank, ensuring the integrity\n",
        "of the data. For instance, if the column represents an important piece of information (like a\n",
        "username or email), leaving it NULL could lead to incomplete or incorrect records.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Ensuring Consistency:\n",
        "By disallowing NULL, you ensure that all rows have valid, consistent data for that column,\n",
        "which is essential for any operations or analysis on that column. For example, in an\n",
        "employee table, you may want to ensure that all employees have a name and age, as leaving\n",
        "them NULL would result in incomplete employee records.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Simplifying Logic:\n",
        "The NOT NULL constraint removes the need to check for NULL values in queries, simplifying\n",
        "the logic when accessing or manipulating data. This is especially helpful in applications or\n",
        "reporting systems where data completeness is critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values?\n",
        "No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values. Here's why:\n",
        "1. Uniqueness:\n",
        "The primary key enforces uniqueness, meaning that each row in the table must have\n",
        "a unique identifier. If a primary key column allowed NULL, it would violate this\n",
        "uniqueness requirement, because NULL represents the absence of a value, and\n",
        "multiple rows with NULL values would technically be considered \"equal\" (since NULL\n",
        "is not comparable to any other value, including other NULL values).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Identification:\n",
        "A primary key is used to uniquely identify each record in the table. If it allowed\n",
        "NULL, there would be no way to uniquely identify the row, making the concept of a\n",
        "primary key useless. For example, if two rows had a NULL primary key value, they\n",
        "wouldn't have unique identifiers, which is fundamentally against the purpose of a\n",
        "primary key.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Database Integrity:\n",
        "Allowing NULL values in the primary key would compromise data integrity, as it\n",
        "would make it impossible to guarantee that each row in the table could be retrieved\n",
        "or referenced uniquely. This would lead to inconsistent data relationships, especially\n",
        "when dealing with foreign keys or joins.\n",
        "\n",
        "Justification:\n",
        "To summarize, primary keys cannot contain NULL values because:\n",
        "Uniqueness:\n",
        "A primary key must uniquely identify each row, and NULL values cannot be\n",
        "considered unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "Identification:\n",
        "A primary key serves to provide a unique identifier for each record; NULL\n",
        "cannot act as an identifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Integrity:\n",
